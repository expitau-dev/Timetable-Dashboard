# Timetable Dashboard
This project provides a front and backend for managing teachers' timetables. Using `docker-compose up -d`, starts listening on port 80. Login with the administrator credentials below, or create a (local) account.

    username: cs@cs.com
    password: cs

And you should be met with a dashboard that shows a list of all current students (which can also be imported/exported from a csv file.). Drag and drop classes to create different timetables, with multiple views.
